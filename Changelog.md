- **Developer Notes**
  - Better Hud
    - I'm not sure Better HUD needs extensive testing, UI mods are usually okay, unless something is real fucky. 
  - Better Pikes
    - This is a cool mod that makes pikes more useful, but it requires troop tree like De Re Militari or specifically troops with pikes with 400 length to use, which I don't currently have
  - Breakable Polearms
    - This is an interesting mod, considering shields break, why shouldn't long polearms with wood break? Also not a requirement to Better Pikes but it compliments it
