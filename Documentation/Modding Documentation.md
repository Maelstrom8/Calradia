## Mods used in the list / MO2

**[Realistic Battle Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/791)**

*This mod makes combat more realistic. Armor and damage is reworked according to experimental data. Weapons attack faster. Units parry and block more. Projectile damage is based on kinetic energy, ranged weapons use draw and projectile weight based simulation. AI tactics improved. Units climb ladders during siege. Optional unit overhaul included*.

**Compatibility Notes**: 

Any mod that affects stats of bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts is not compatible with the combat module. Any mod that adds armors and/or weapons is NOT compatible with Combat Module unless there is a RBM patch for it.
