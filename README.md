# Calradia Under Fire

---

# Introduction

Calradia Under Fire is a modlist for the v1.0.3 version of Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, with a small catch. It's a customizable modlist. The modlist uses Novus Launcher - a tool made by a modder. Originally, all your enabled mods would be detected in the standard launcher and you would be playing with a veryu specific set of mods, but I don't care for that. With Novus Launcher I can add 100+ mods, and then within the launcher anyone can choose which mods to enable and use, effectively being able to use presets. So that's what I did. 

I threw together a functional modlist featuring some cool mods like Realistic Battle Mod, Banner Kings, and more - which functions as the base. Players can use the provided preset, or they can make their own. The thing is that not every mod is compatible with each other, so it's a learning experience!

PS. This modlist is not associated with the game "Kingdoms Under Fire".


## Gameplay / Information


Below I will cover what the existing preset (modlist!) consists of, and what to expect. If you are looking to modify this or stick your head into the deeper ends, please see [TBA]


# Installation 


TBA


# Requirements 

TBA

You need to own a legitimate copy of Mount and Blade: Bannerlord - through Steam. Also, it needs to be unmodified / clean.

Also, extremely important - [this modlist only works on v1.0.3](https://i.imgur.com/9D3q6s4.png). DO NOT UPDATE THE GAME OR TRY TO PLAY IT ON BETA. 

To change this, go to Properties > Beta and select v1.0.3 - v1.0.3.


# Wabbajack Instructions

Small little walkthrough for first time WJ installers. Already installed it? Sick. Move to the next relevant point.


### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your game root folder. Do not extract it to Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.


### Installing Calradia Under Fire

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Find Ascalon, click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder, following the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating Calradia At War is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.


### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Who are you kidding, it's like 10GB, you don't need it homie.


### Launching Calradia Under Fire

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Calradia At War folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, youâ€™ll see a large dropdown menu. Novus Launcher should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
