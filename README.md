# Introduction

Calradia Under Fire is a modlist for the v1.1.0 version of Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord. Calradia Under Fire makes use of a mod launcher called Novus Launcher, which allows users to make and customize load order presets for mods. This is basically what MO2 is for Bethesda games. Bannerlord has a basic MO2 plugin, and allows you to make profile presets, but because of how the game is built, MO2 can only really operate as a vfs. You need an additional tool such as Novus Launcher or BUTRLoader to then organize the load order of the mods.

Getting all that out of the way.. Calradia Under Fire is a dual purpose modlist. Keep reading to figure out. 

(This has nothing to do with the game Kingdoms: Under Fire)


## Gameplay / Information

Calradia Under Fire ships with two load order presets (within Novus Launcher): **ModlistProfile** and **BasicEssentials**

- **ModlistProfile** is the MAIN profile, the modlist itself, which consists of about 50 to 60 mods and is what the standard user should select. It is a modlist focused around Realistic Battle Mod & Banner Kings. Features include the troop overhaul Warlords Battlefield, armors such as Open Source Armory, Swadian Armory, Vaegir Armory and many other QoL mods.

**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO NOT MODIFY IT**
**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO NOT MODIFY IT**
**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO NOT MODIFY IT**
**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO NOT MODIFY IT**
**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DO NOT MODIFY IT**

- **BasicEssentials** is where the second purpose of the modlist comes in. Contains the bare minimum mods such as Harmony and what not. This is for advanced users to make their own load order based off the mods provided within MO2, not only that but allows me to make changes and test things. 


If you would like to get a bit deeper into modifications and or learn more about the **main profile** - head on over to the [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/CalradiaUnderFire/blob/main/Documentation/Modding%20Documentation.md)

# Requirements & Installation

You need to own a legitimate copy of Mount and Blade: Bannerlord - through Steam (I do not support anything else), which needs to be unmodified / clean. Delete the whole thing and or verify files if you run into any issues.

This modlist only works for version 1.1.0 of Bannerlord. Do not update to any beta. Go to Properties > Beta and make sure none is selected. Also make sure the game only updates when you launch the game.

## System Requirements

| **CPU**   |  Intel® Core™ i5-9600K / AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600X   |  
| **Graphics**    | NVIDIA GTX 1060 3GB / AMD Radeon™ RX 580  |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM |

Honestly I just copied this from the recommended specs from the Steam page. I expect you to have a decent PC in 2023, and I also recommend that you install this list on an SSD

On top of having the base game installed (47GB), you must have an addtional 52GB of space for the modlist (16GB downloads + 36GB install)

### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your game root folder. Do not extract it to locations such as Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.



### Installing Calradia Under Fire

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Filter by Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord. Click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder, following the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating Calradia Under Fire is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.



### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium



If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Who are you kidding, it's like 16GB, you don't need it homie.



## POST INSTALLATION (PLEASE READ)

- If you don't do the steps in this category the game won't work.. uh.. yeah no it won't work.

1. After you successfully installed the list, navigate to the folder you installed the list - ([example])(https://i.imgur.com/3rKIdRO.png)
2. Inside there is a folder in big large caps "GAME FILES FOLDER", it consists of two folders; Configs and Novus Launcher. You need to manually move these.


`Configs` is responsible for saved MCM configurations of mods. Copy the whole folder over to "YourUserName\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\" - ((example)[https://i.imgur.com/oSyPZoS.png])

`Novus Launcher` .. is responsible for everything. Copy this folder to your ROOT Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord folder - ([example])(https://i.imgur.com/vPIodfH.png)


2. Launch Mod Organizer 2, navigate to the top left of the program. See the giant green RUN BUTTON? Don't click it, fucker. Next to it is a drop down box, expand it and hit `<Edit..>`
3. All the way to the left next to Executables, hit the Plus sign - add from file. Navigate to your root game folder for Bannerlord and select the NovusLauncher.exe within its folder then hit apply.



### Launching Calradia Under Fire

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Calradia Under Fire folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, you’ll see a large dropdown menu - open it. Select Novus Launcher. Click the large Run button.
3. Within Novus Launcher, select only one preset from the top drop down. You should know what these are.
4. Hit the green play button.
5. ???
6. Profit!
